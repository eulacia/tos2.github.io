E.M. Forster wrote this final, unsurpassable paragraph about watching your man sleepingâ€”that's why I never really had the courage to write something myself.

*The boy, who had been to a dance the night before, remained asleep. He lay with his limbs uncovered. He lay unashamed, embraced and penetrated by the sun. The lips were parted, the down on the upper was touched with gold, the hair broken into countless glories, the body was a delicate amber. To anyone he would have seemed beautiful, and to Maurice who reached him by two paths he became the World's desire.* (E.M. Forster, in *Maurice*, 1913)
